 * Note that if the _structure_ of the path changes, the buildout of the path
 * will have to change accordingly. If everything is set up correctly, this
 * _should_ occur without anything breaking.
 *
 * After development, a relatively _flat_ alphabetical type directory structure appears
 * to be working quite well. That is, the individual directories _underneath_ the
 * single letter top level directories are easy to find and don't appear to get
 * lost in the shuffle, primarily _because_ the first letter (or another clearly
 * identifying letter) is used as the top level directory, and when clicking on
 * that letter, it reveals the full name directly underneath it. To handle a path
 * part that contains two, three or four or more directories in it, this was handled
 * at first by using the word `STUB` and then building that stub. However, this
 * resulted in too many variations, with more constants than seemed necessary.
 *
 * In its place, allowing the directory name to refer to the letter of the top
 * level directory _plus_ the directory underneath it, keeps everything nice and
 * brief, with fewer constants in total.  Even though this approach does not keep
 * the technical definition of the word "directory" intact, it still allows for
 * adjustment in the case that the directory being named needs to be moved. This can
 * happen in the definition, rather than elsewhere.
 *
 * @example define( 'SITE_CORE_DIR_STUB', SITE_E_DIR . SITE_CORE_DIR ); vs.
 * @example define( 'SITE_CORE_DIR', '/e/core' );
 *
 * Clearly, the second example easier to work with as the main function of the
 * "/e" directory is the "engine" or the core. Simpler is better.

 * Here we can begin to think about including other frameworks in the

 * is optimized best for certain purposes (like blogs). Although it can handle
 * other tasks (such as forums), other frameworks may be better suited for these
 * functions as they have been developed specifically for that purpose. Some of these
 * are phpBB (which has been around for a while), Feng Office (a project management
 * framework), mediaWiki (best known for its use in Wikipedia) and others, some of which
 * may not even have been developed yet.
 *
 * Since we are developing out a community framework that can assist us in being more
 * flexible, constistent and standardized across different uses, this can be a big help.
 *
 * For example, the URL ending for the WordPress administrative section is /wp-admin by
 * default. This can be changed with a plugin (already done here). By starting the admin
 * URL with /admin, we can then attach /wp at the _end_ of it. This then frees us up to
 * think about these other frameworks. This would then look like:
 *
 * - /admin/wp
 * - /admin/forum
 * - /admin/project
 * - /admin/wiki
 *
 * Each of these is unique and already has open sourced packages available which then
 * perform much better already "out of the box". This is what we are after.

 * with much greater confidence that it will still work, PROVIDED that there
 * is only a single connection to the underlying directory FROM that stub.
 * That is, no other routes to get there that are used. So, it has then to
