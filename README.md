# EC01 Config

A set of constants for the framework EC01, which can be used with WordPress. They all begin with the prefix `SITE_`. Some of the features include:

* Constructs the URL based on the environment (i.e. local vs. production).
* Switches to determine whether WordPress or the basic framework (EC01 HTML) is used.
